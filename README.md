# Rail Buddy - Smart India Hackathon 2024
Rail Buddy is an innovative solution designed to optimize railway station navigation for passengers, including people with disabilities. This project provides real-time navigation, shortest pathfinding using the A* algorithm, and future integration of AR features.

## Key Features:
- **Real-Time Navigation**: Provides real-time GPS-based navigation inside the railway station.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Uses the A* algorithm to calculate the shortest path between waypoints.
- **Disability Support**: Includes separate paths for people with disabilities.
- **3D Exploration**: Future plans to integrate AR exploration of the station via Unity.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Developed using Flutter for a seamless user experience on mobile.

## Technologies:
- **Flutter**: For the mobile app development.
- **Google Maps API**: For live navigation and mapping.
- **A* Pathfinding**: For calculating the shortest route.
- **GPX File Processing**: For route waypoints and navigation.
- **Unity**: For future AR integration.
